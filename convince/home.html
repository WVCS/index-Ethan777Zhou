    <p> Usually when people use the word “weeaboo” against anime lovers, most of the time they don’t know what the word actually means and thinks it means something bad and something that has to do with Japan. The reason people call anime fans this word is because they like anime, therefore classifying them as a Weeaboo. </p>

    <p> The difference between Anime Fans and Weeaboos is quite a big one. A Weeaboo is one that watches anime but disrespects Japanese Culture thinking they know everything about it. On the other hand, Anime fans, watch anime but instead of disrespecting the culture and making themselves look like fools, appreciate the culture and would learn it. </p>
