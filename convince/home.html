    <p> Not all agree that riding a bike is better than using an automobile. One of the main advantages with using a car to get around is that it is convenient and doesn't require much work. With biking, the rider must have enough endurance in order to get where they want to go. When using a car, you don't have to think twice about how much work it will take to get to your destination. Another problem with cycling is that you are greatly affected by the weather because you don't have any sort of weather protection system. With a car, you have a roof and windows to protect against wind and rain and an air conditioning system to protect against the heat and cold. Though cars seem to have bigger advantages to bikes, the cost of using a car and maintaining it is very high. Along with that, the carbon dioxide emissions are great in a car which is unhealthy for the environment.</p>
